## Phosphorylation Mechanisms

We have:

**Ligand binding and dissociation**. L + T <-> LT with rate `k_lr_bind`, `k_lr_dis`.

**Receptor complex autophosphorylation**. The receptor complex is composed of MCPs, CheW, and CheA. CheA undergoes autophosphorylation, and the rate of autophosphorylation depends on conformation of the receptor complex. Faster autophosphorylation for free MCPs. Note that the phosphoryl group is from an ATP->ADP reaction, but we will just code as phosphorylation states in modeling for simplicity. 
 - T -> T-P    rate constant `k_T_phos`
 - LT -> LT-P  rate constant `0.2 · k_T_phos`

**CheY phosphorylation and dephosphorylation**. CheA-P phosphorylates CheY. Phosphorylated CheY will be responsible for the cellular response (CW rotataion), so we will use the level of CheY-P to indicate the level of cellular response. 
 - T-P + CheY -> T + CheY-P  `k_Y_phos`
 - Z + Y-P -> Z + Y + P `k_Y_dephos`

## Include phosphorylation in the model

You can download the simulation file here: 
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/downloadable/phosphorylation.bngl" download="phosphorylation.bngl">phosphorylation.bngl</a>

First, we introduce `state` in our particles to mark whether it is phosphorylated or not. Change `T(l)` to `T(l,Phos~U~P)`. The `Phos~U~P` indicates we introduce phosphorylation states to `T`: `U` indicates unphosphorylated, and `P` indicates phosphorylated. You can also use other letters. We also add molecule `CheY(Phos~U~P)` and `CheZ()`. (*Note: be careful with the use of spaces; don't put spaces after the comma.*)

~~~ ruby
	begin molecule types
		L(t)             #ligand molecule
		T(l,Phos~U~P)    #receptor complex
		CheY(Phos~U~P)
		CheZ()
	end molecule types
~~~

And we update the reaction rules with the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions above.

~~~ ruby
	begin reaction rules
		LigandReceptor: L(t) + T(l) <-> L(t!1).T(l!1) k_lr_bind, k_lr_dis
		
		#Free vs. ligand-bound complexes autophosphorylates
		FreeTP: T(l,Phos~U) -> T(l,Phos~P) k_T_phos
		BoundTP: L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~U) -> L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~P) k_T_phos*0.2
		
		YP: T(Phos~P) + CheY(Phos~U) -> T(Phos~U) + CheY(Phos~P) k_Y_phos
		YDep: CheZ() + CheY(Phos~P) -> CheZ() + CheY(Phos~U) k_Y_dephos
	end reaction rules
~~~

We need to indicate the number of molecules at **each state** present at the beginning of the simulation. Since we are adding ligands at the beginnin of the simulation, the initial amount of molecules at each same state should be equal to the equilibrium concentrations when no ligand is present.

~~~ ruby
	begin seed species
		L(t) L0
		T(l,Phos~U) T0*0.8
		T(l,Phos~P) T0*0.2
		CheY(Phos~U) CheY0*0.5
		CheY(Phos~P) CheY0*0.5
		CheZ() CheZ0
	end seed species
~~~

Update all the parameters based on *in vivo* quantities [^Li2004][^Spiro1997][^Stock1991]. Specifically, we include the number of CheY, CheZ, and the rate constants for receptor complex autophosphorylation, CheY phosphorylation, and CheZ dephosphorylation.

~~~ ruby
	begin parameters
		NaV 6.02e8   #Unit conversion to cellular concentration M/L -> #/um^3
		L0 0        #number of ligand molecules
		T0 7000       #number of receptor complexes
		CheY0 20000
		CheZ0 6000
		
		k_lr_bind 8.8e6/NaV   #ligand-receptor binding
		k_lr_dis 35           #ligand-receptor dissociation
		k_T_phos 15           #receptor complex autophosphorylation
		k_Y_phos 3.8e6/NaV    #receptor complex phosphorylates CheY
		k_Y_dephos 8.6e5/NaV  #Z dephosphoryaltes CheY
	end parameters
~~~

We are also interested in the number of T-P and CheY-P during the simulation.

~~~ ruby
	begin observables
		Molecules phosphorylated_CheY CheY(Phos~P)
		Molecules phosphorylated_CheA T(Phos~P)
		Molecules bound_ligand L(t!1).T(l!1)
	end observables
~~~

Observe the simulation for a bit longer. Change `t_end` at the bottom to 3. 

~~~ ruby
	generate_network({overwrite=>1})
	simulate({method=>"ssa", t_end=>3, n_steps=>100})
~~~

## Simulating responses to attractants

Before running the simulation, let's think about what will happen. If we don't add any ligand molecule into the system, then T phosphorylation happens at rate [*T*]*k_T_phos*, and T will phosphorylate CheY, which will be dephosphorylated by CheZ. The concentrations of phosphorylated T and CheY will stay at a steady state. That's the initial concentrations of molecules at each state we defined earlier. 

Run simulation with no ligand molecule present by setting `L0` in the `parameters` section to 0, and click `Run` under `Simulate`. What do you observe?

When we add ligand molecules into the system, as we did in the tutorial for [ligand-receptor dynamics](tutorial_lr), concentration of bound T increases. What will happen to the concentration of phosphorylated CheA, and phosphorylated CheY? What will happen to steady state concentrations?

Run simulation with `L0 = 5000` and `L0 = 1e5` to confirm your hypothesis. What do you observe?

For different `L0`'s, how do the steady state for bound ligand, active receptor, and active CheY differ and why?

Exercise: Try several different `L0` values (ex. 1e3, 1e7, 1e9). Are you seeing what you expected? If at some point the result won't change anymore, why? What does it imply about limitation in chemotaxis (but it's already a wide range of concentrations isn't it)?

## Simulating responses to repellents

You can download the simulation file here: 
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/downloadable/phosphorylation_repel.bngl" download="phosphorylation_repel.bngl">phosphorylation_repel.bngl</a>

Recall that CheA autophosphorylation is faster when the receptor is bound to repellents. We modify the rate of receptor complex autophosphorylation when ligand is bound.
 - T -> T-P    rate `k_T_phos`
 - LT -> LT-P  rate `5 · k_T_phos`

In `reaction rules`, update

	BoundTP: L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~U) -> L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~P) k_T_phos*0.2

to 

	BoundTP: L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~U) -> L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~P) k_T_phos*5

When we add repellent ligand molecules into the system, concentration of bound T increases. What will happen to the concentration of phosphorylated CheA, and phosphorylated CheY? What will happen to steady-state concentrations?

Run simulation with `L0 = 5000` and `L0 = 1e5`. What do you observe?
