## Modeling traveling down the gradient with BNG

We have simulated how CheY-P changes when the cell moves up the attractant gradient. With higher concentrations, methylation states change so that they can compensate for the more ligand-receptor binding to restore the CheY phosphorylation level. What if the ligands are removed? Along with increased CheY-P because the cell need to tumble more to "escape" from the wrong direction, we should see methylation states return to the states before the addition of ligands.

First create a copy of the adaptation model `adaptation.bngl`, name it `removal.bngl`.

To simulate the removal of ligand, or the traveling down the gradient, we will add a "fake reaction" that the ligand disappear with a certain rate. Add this rule within the `reaction rules` section.

~~~ ruby
	#Simulate ligand removal
	LigandGone: L(t) -> 0 k_gone
~~~

In `parameters` section, we define the `k_gone` to be 0.3 first and thus d[L]/dt = -0.3[L]. By integration, we can represent the concentration as [L] = 10<sup>7</sup>e<sup>-0.3t</sup>. We will also change the initial ligand concentration to be 1e7. Thus, the concentration of ligand becomes so low that ligand-receptor binding reaches 0 within 50 seconds.

~~~ ruby
		k_gone 0.3
		L0 1e7
~~~

We will set the initial concentrations of all `seed species` to be the final concentrations of the simulation result for our `adaptation.bngl` model, and see if our simulation can restore them to the inital concentrations of the `adaptation.bngl` model.

Go to the `adaptation.bngl` model, and set `L0` as `1e7`. Also include concentration of each combination of methylation state and ligand binding state of the receptor complex as `observables`. (Concentration of other sepcies are already restored to original state when adapting, like CheY-P). Run the simulation. Go to `RuleBender-workspace/PROJECT_NAME/results/adaptation/` and find the simulation result at the final time point.

Input those concentrations to the `seed species` section of our `removal.bngl` model.

~~~ ruby
	begin seed species
		@EC:L(t) L0
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~A,Phos~U).L(t!1) 1190
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~B,Phos~U).L(t!1) 2304
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~C,Phos~U).L(t!1) 2946
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~A,Phos~P).L(t!1) 2
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~B,Phos~P).L(t!1) 156
		@PM:T(l!1,r,Meth~C,Phos~P).L(t!1) 402
		@CP:CheY(Phos~U) CheY0*0.71
		@CP:CheY(Phos~P) CheY0*0.29
		@CP:CheZ() CheZ0
		@CP:CheB(Phos~U) CheB0*0.62
		@CP:CheB(Phos~P) CheB0*0.38
		@CP:CheR(t) CheR0
	end seed species
~~~

The simulation can also be downloaded here: <a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/downloadable/removal.bngl" download="removal.bngl">removal.bngl</a>

Set `simulate({method=>"ssa", t_end=>1800, n_steps=>1800})`. Go to `simulation` and click `Run`. What happens to CheY phosphorylation? Compare the steady state concentration of each methylation states, are they restored to the level before adding ligands to the `adaptation.bngl` model?

Similar to what we did for up gradient, we can try different values for `k_gone`. Change `t_end` in the `simulate` method to 1800 seconds, and simulate with `k_gone` = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5.

All simulation results are stored in the `RuleBender-workspace/PROJECT_NAME/results/MODEL_NAME/TIME/` directory in your computer. Rename the directory with the `k_gone` values instead of the time of running for simplicity.

## Visualizing the results

We will use the jupyter notebook <a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/downloadable/plotter_up.ipynb" download="plotter_up.ipynb">plotter_down.ipynb</a> to visualize results. First specify the directories, model name, species of interest, and rates. Put the `RuleBender-workspace/PROJECT_NAME/results/MODEL_NAME/` folder inside the same directory as the Jupyter notebook or change the `model_path`.

~~~ python
	model_path = "removal"  #The folder containing the model
	model_name = "removal"  #Name of the model
	target = "phosphorylated_CheY"    #Target molecule
	vals = [0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]  #Gradients of interest
~~~

The second code block will load simulation result at each time point from the `.gdat` file, which stores concentration of all `observables` at all steps, and plot concentration of phosphorylated CheY through time.

Run the code blocks. How does `k_gone` impact the CheY-P concentrations? Why? Are the tumbling frequencies restored to the background frequency?
