* If you have not already done so, try modeling the SARS-CoV-2 S protein or RBD using SWISS-MODEL, Robetta, or GalaxyWEB using the steps in<a href="tutorial_homology" target="blank">Homology Structure Prediction Tutorial</a>. Then, use ProDy to calculate the RMSD between your models and the PDB entries <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VXX" target="blank">6vxx</a> for the S protein and <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LZG" target="blank">6lzg</a> for the RBD. Did your models perform better than our models? 

* Using VMD, model the SARS-CoV-2 S (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VXX" target="blank">6vxx</a>) protein and SARS S (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5X58" target="blank">5x58</a>) protein. Create the graphical representation of glycans and compare the number of glycans between the two proteins. Are they any different? Could this possibly be another reason why SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than SARS?
