## The world's fastest outbreak

On February 21, 2003, a Chinese doctor named Liu Jianlun flew to Hong Kong to attend a wedding and checked into Room 911 of the Metropole Hotel. The next day, he became too ill to attend the wedding and was admitted to a hospital. Two weeks later, Dr. Liu was dead.

On his deathbed, Liu told doctors that he had recently treated sick patients in Guangdong Province, China where a deadly, highly contagious respiratory illness had infected hundreds of people. The Chinese government had made brief mention of this incident to the World Health Organization but had concluded that the likely culprit was a common bacterial infection. By the time anyone realized the severity of the disease, it was already too late to stop the outbreak. On February 23, a man who had stayed across the hall from Dr. Liu at the Metropole traveled to Hanoi and died after infecting 80 people. On February 26, a woman checked out of the Metropole, traveled back to Toronto, and died after initiating an outbreak there. On March 1, a third guest was admitted to a hospital in Singapore, where sixteen additional cases of the illness arose within two weeks.[^3][^4].

Consider that it took four years for the Black Death, which killed over a third of all Europeans in the 14th Century, to travel from Constantinople to Kiev. Or that HIV took two decades to circle the globe. In contrast, this mysterious new disease had crossed the Pacific Ocean within a week of entering Hong Kong.

As health officials braced for the impact of the fastest-traveling virus in human history, panic set in. Businesses were closed, sick passengers were removed from airplanes, and Chinese officials threatened to execute infected patients who violated quarantine. In the process, the mysterious new disease earned a name: **Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome**, or **SARS**.

## Finding the source of the outbreak

SARS was deadly, killing close to 10% of those who became sick.[^cdc-factsheet] But it also struggled to spread much farther within the human population, and it was contained in July 2003 with fewer than 10,000 confirmed symptomatic cases worldwide.

Scientists initially thought that humans had contracted SARS from palm civets, which are native to Guangdong. But research would later show that the disease likely originated in bats, a notorious disease carrier.[^bats]

And in 2017, researchers published the result of five years of sampling horseshoe bats from a cave in Yunnan province. They found that the bats harbored coronaviruses with remarkable genetic similarity to SARS, and they hypothesized that the bats may have in fact derived from horseshoe bats. Yet their work is now famous because they identified viruses that were similar to SARS and capable of entering human cells. The following lines from their article are now chilling.[^bat-cave]

> We have also revealed that various SARSr-CoVs ... are still circulating among bats in this region. Thus, the risk of spillover into people and emergence of a disease similar to SARS is possible. This is particularly important given that the nearest village to the bat cave we surveyed is only 1.1 km away, which indicates a potential risk of exposure to bats for the local residents. Thus, we propose that monitoring of SARSr-CoV evolution at this and other sites should continue, as well as examination of human behavioral risk for infection and serological surveys of people, to determine if spillover is already occurring at these sites and to design intervention strategies to avoid future disease emergence.

## A new threat arises: the COVID-19 pandemic

“One of the world's most important warning systems for a deadly new outbreak is a doctor's or nurse's recognition that some new disease is emerging and then sounding the alarm”, said Tom Inglesby, the Director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD, USA. “It takes intelligence and courage to step up and say something like that, even in the best of circumstances.”

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic that is believed to have started in Wuhan, China. Although not confirmed, it is believed that the first case dates to 17 November 2019 [^7]. On 31 December 2019, the WHO received reports regarding numerous cases of pneumonia of an undetermined cause from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The next day, the WHO activates the three-level Incident Management Support Team to assess the new disease. The disease spread extremely quickly throughout the city where cases doubled every 7.4 days [^8]. By the end of January, 7818 cases were confirmed across 19 countries, resulting in the WHO declaring the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [^9][^10].

The next day, Russia, Italy, and United Kingdom reported their first cases of COVID-19 and joined the list affected countries. From then on, the number of COVID-19 cases exploded, spreading to around 213 countries and territories across the globe as of 17 August 2020.

### Why were the two outbreaks so different?

The similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 extends well beyond their names. They are both coronaviruses, which means that they are covered in a layer of **Spike proteins** that cause them to look like the sun's corona during an eclipse. In fact, if we look at them under a microscope, they look virtually identical. Both viruses use the same means to infect human cells, by bonding to the ACE2 enzyme on the cellular membrane.[^16][^17] And they cause the same symptoms in humans. So why did SARS fizzle, but SARS-CoV-2, a less harmful[^11][^12] and less deadly disease, transform into an uncontrollable pandemic?

* Insert coronavirus image.

We do not wish to diminish the importance of political and social measures to quell the spread of a disease. Yet at the same time, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread across far more countries and remain a public health threat even in the face of lockdowns can only be explained by its virulence.

Part of the reason for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is that it can be spread by individuals that are asymptomatic,[^13] a method of transmission that was never found in SARS.[^14] But we also wonder if we can find a *biological* basis for the difference between the two viruses.

There are two main objectives for this module. First, we will put ourselves in the shoes of early SARS-CoV-2 researchers studying the spike protein of the new virus in January 2020 right as the new virus's genome was sequenced. Can we determine the structure of the viral Spike protein using only its genome?  Second, and more importantly, once we know the structure of this Spike protein in SARS-Cov-2, we will compare it against the same protein in SARS. If we can find a molecular explanation of why this virus can more easily attack our cells, then perhaps we can use this information to start defending against it.
