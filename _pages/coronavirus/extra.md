## Extra (structure intro): Four levels of protein structure

These amino acids are linked together to form a protein as a amino acid chain, or polypeptide chain, that will typically undergo folding to obtain a 3D structure. In the first figure below, the general shape of the amino acid is shown: a central alpha-Carbon, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and finally one of 20 side-groups that differentiate the amino acids. Each amino acid is linked to the next by a peptide bond, and it is this connection and alpha-Carbon that make up the protein backbone, as shown in the second figure. The side groups of each amino acid are responsible for amino acid's chemical properties. These chemical properties allow the amino acids to interact with each other and fold into the 3D structure.

We stated that the overall 3D structure (tertiary structure) of the protein is dictated by the interactions of the side chains. Even when we unfold, or denature, a protein, it will eventually fold back into essentially the same shape because of these interactions.

Protein structure are separated into four different levels of description. The most basic description, the **primary structure**, refers the specific amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain. Below is an example of the human hemoglobin subunit alpha and its primary structure.

The **secondary structure** describes the highly regular substructures in the protein. Essentially, they are the 3D structures of local amino acids groups within the protein and spontaneously form during the folding process. In a sense, they are the intermediate structures that form before the overall protein structure. The two main substructures, shown in the figure below, are alpha-helices (left) and beta-sheets (right). Alpha-helices are formed when local amino acids fold into a tube-like structure. Beta-sheets are when the local amino acids interact by lining up side-by-side, forming a sheet-like structure. The formation of these secondary structures help with the overall process of folding.

The **tertiary structure** describes the overall 3D shape of the protein that results from the fully-folded polypeptide chain. This is what we think of as the "shape" of the protein. In a sense, it is the combination of all the secondary structures and linkages that creates the tertiary structure. Below is the tertiary structure of human hemoglobin subunit alpha.

Finally, some proteins have a **quaternary structure**, which describes the proteinâ€™s interaction with other copies of itself to form a single functional unit, or a multimer. Many proteins do not have a quaternary structure and functions as an independent monomer.

Proteins are can often be divided into protein domains. Domains are distinct functional/structural units within the protein and are typically responsible for a specific interaction or function. For example, The Sars-CoV-2 S protein has a Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that is responsible for interacting with ACE2. The rest of the protein does not come into contact with ACE2.
