## Part 1 conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 protein structure prediction and open science

The models we assessed here may not be 100% accurate, but they all do a good job of approximating protein structure when this structure is not yet known experimentally. We have yet to decipher nature's magic algorithm for protein folding, and yet we can retain hope that continued improvements to our algorithms and ever-increasing computational resources will allow us to one day say, "good enough!".

We also hope that this discussion has provided perspective on how a problem in biological modeling can be easy to state and very difficult to solve. This is in sharp contrast to our work in previous modules, where we saw biological models that more or less quickly solved the problems presented to them. After all, the Soviets founded an entire [research insitute](https://www.protres.ru) dedicated to protein research in 1967. Most of the scientists who were there for its grand opening are dead now, and yet the institute carries on.

Finally, we would point out that although scientific research five decades ago was, like the Soviet protein institute, siloed away from the public, the COVID-19 pandemic offers an excellent example of how citizens around the world can follow and even get involved in real research.

For example, the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org) organization published their first publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome on December 24, 2019. Within six months, this database had grown to contain over 50,000 entries. At any point in early 2020, anyone could have grabbed their favorite SARS-CoV-2 genome, excised the sequence of the spike protein, and used one of a variety of different software resources to predict its structure. Alternatively, a more communally minded person could have enlisted their home machine as part of a global race to provide vaccine developers with accurate estimations of the protein's structure. Despite 2020 being a time of international crisis, the progress we have made in opening scientific research to the public is cause for optimism.

Thus ends part 1 of this module. But there is still much for us to discuss. We hope that you will join us for part 2, in which we will delve into the differences between the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 using the validated protein structures published to PDB early in the pandemic. Can we use modeling and computation to determine why SARS-CoV-2 has been so much more infectious? We hope that you will join us to find out.
