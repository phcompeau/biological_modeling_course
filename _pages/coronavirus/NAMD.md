We identified and visualized three regions of marked conformational differences between the RBD of SARS Spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. However, how much do each region contribute to the binding of ACE2, and can we get a quantitative measure of how much the changes in the regions effect binding affinity? <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/" target="_blank">NAMD</a> is a parallel molecular dynamics code that was designed for high-performance large biomolecular system simulations that is most commonly used with VMD. <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/namdenergy/" target="_blank">NAMD Energy</a> is a plugin within VMD that utilizes NAMD to intermolecular and intramolecular energies of molecules in units of kcal/mol. This plugin will allow us to calculate the interaction energy between ACE2 and Spike RBD. In addition, NAMD Energy allows users to select specific regions, which will help us evaluate how much each of the three regions contributes.

## Introduction to Potential Energy in Molecules

In part one of the module, we went over that high energy molecules are unstable and low energy molecules are stable. When we are talking about the energy of a system or molecule, we are referring to its potential energy.  More specifically, **potential energy** is defined as the energy stored within an object due to its position, state, and arrangement. In molecular mechanics, the potential energy is made up of the sum of bonded energy (energy related to covalent bonds) and nonbonded energy (energy from interactions not from covalent bonds) for all atoms in the molecule.

Bonded energy can be broken down into three terms: bond, angle, and dihedral. We will explain here what each term represents as additional information, but this is beyond the scope of this module as it gets extremely complicated. The bond term describes the potential between a pair of covalently bonded atoms and is represented by harmonic potential, or in simpler terms, bond stretching. The angle term describes the potential between a triplet of atoms covalently bonded like a ‘V’ shape and is represented by angle vibration. Finally, the dihedral term describes the potential between a consecutively bonded quadruplet of atoms and are represented by the angular spring between the plane formed by the first three atoms and the plane formed by the last three atoms [^TCBG].

Nonbond energy can be broken down into two terms: electrostatic interactions (Coulomb potential) and van der Waals interactions (Lennard-Jones potential). **Electrostatic interaction** refers to the attraction and repulsion force from the electric charge of the atoms. To calculate the total electrostatic interaction, we need to consider this interaction between every atom pair within the molecule. Just like proteins, atoms are dynamic systems. The electrons are constantly circling around the nucleus and at any given time, they could be localized on one side. This will cause the atom to have a temporary negative charge on one side and positive charge on the other side. In addition, nearby atoms can also influence the electron cloud. These temporary charges are referred to as **induced dipoles**. **Van der Waals** interaction refers to the attraction and repulsion force between atoms from these induced dipoles.

To compute potential energies, we need what is known as a **force field**. A force field contains a functional form on how to compute these energies on each particle in the molecule or system and a set of parameters that describe how energy is determined by the positional relationship between atoms [^charmm]. There are many different force fields depending on the specific type of system, e.g. DNA, RNA, lipids. These sets of force fields are offered by many molecular mechanics groups. For example, *<a href=" https://www.charmm.org/" target="_blank">Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics (CHARMM)</a>* offers a set of force fields for molecular dynamics.

NAMD needs to utilize the information in the force field to calculate the potential energy of a protein. To do this, it needs a **protein structure file (PSF)**. A PSF, which is molecule-specific, contains all the information required to apply a force field to a molecular system [^PSF]. Fortunately, there are programs that can generate a PSF given the force field and protein structure (PDB file).

In this tutorial, we will show how to calculate the interaction energy between the SARS-CoV-2 (Chimeric) RBD and ACE using the PDB entry <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6vw1" target="_blank">6vw1</a> and the NAMD Energy plugin within VMD. To do this, we will be using a force field from CHARMM that is included in VMD package as well as the AutoPSF plugin to generate the necessary PSF file. Finally, we will see how much the loop site contributes to the interaction energy between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2.

## Difference in Interaction Energy Contribution between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 RBD Sites

From the tutorial, we computed the overall interaction energy between the SARS-CoV-2 (chimeric) RBD and ACE2 to be about -220.354 kcal/mol, and that the ridge site contributes about -12.3263 kcal/mol. Negative energy values indicate attractive force, and positive values indicate repulsion force. Therefore, a more negative interaction energy represents greater binding affinity between two molecules. We went ahead and calculated the rest of the interaction energies for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS using the same method as in the tutorial. The results are shown below.

From the results, we see that the overall attractive interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2 is greater in magnitude for SARS-CoV-2, supporting the previous studies that found SARS-CoV-2 Spike having higher affinity with ACE2. For SARS-CoV-2, Hotspot31 (red) has the greatest contribution, followed by Hotspot353 (blue), and finally the loop in the RBM (yellow) providing the least. For SARS, Hotspot353 provides the greatest contribution, followed by the loop, and, surprisingly, Hotspot31 very slightly hindering the interaction. Nevertheless, we see that all three sites in SARS-CoV-2 support binding with ACE2 much more than in SARS. The difference in results support that the residue differences and conformational changes in the three sites do indeed increase the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2.

In the next lesson, we will learn about another protein analysis method that uses molecular dynamics.
