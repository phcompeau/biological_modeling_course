## Installing NFSim and RuleBender

https://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/Faeder/?page_id=409
[We will be using RuleBender as a GUI for NFSim]

## Using RuleBender

Open /RuleBender/RuleBender.exe

File > New BioNetGen Project 

![image-center](../assets/images/nfsim_new_project.png){: .align-center}

Select blank_file.bngl and name your project “oscillators”

![image-center](../assets/images/nfsim_new_file.png){: .align-center}

NOTE: Occasionally an error will pop up to inform the user “There was a failure during the copy of the sample”. The folder will be created, but no files will be loaded. Select File > New > File to create a new blank file.
{: .notice--primary}

Rename your file “oscillator_copy.bngl” and double click the file in the navigator to open the editor window. Once in the editor window, add the following parameters: 

~~~ ruby
begin parameters
 r1 2e3
 r2 6e2
 r3 6e2
 r4 2e2
 r5 6e2
end parameters
~~~

Next, add the molecules used as follows: 

~~~ ruby
begin molecule types
 x(Y~U~P)
 y(Y~U~P)
 z(Y~U~P)
 hx()
 hy()
 hz()
 hx_off()
 hy_off()
 hz_off()
 null()
end molecule types
~~~

Next, specify the quantities of each molecule at the start of the simulation:

~~~ ruby
begin species
 x(Y~U) 150
 y(Y~U) 0
 z(Y~U) 0
 hx() 100
 hy() 100
 hz() 100
 hx_off() 0
 hy_off() 0
 hz_off() 0
 null() 0
end species
~~~

In order to view a plot of the molecules after the simulation is complete, add the following code: 

~~~ ruby
begin observables
 Molecules X x()
 Molecules Y y()
 Molecules Z z()
end observables
~~~

The following are the same reaction rules as used in the CellBlender tutorial. Note that the parameters typed in earlier are also the same as the CellBlender tutorial: 

~~~ ruby
begin reaction rules
 # x copy
 hx() -> hx() + x(Y~U) r1
 x(Y~U) + hy() -> hy_off() + x(Y~P) r2
 hy_off() -> hy() r3
 x(Y~P) -> x(Y~U) r4
 x() -> null() r5
 # y copy
 hy() -> hy() + y(Y~U) r1
 y(Y~U) + hz() -> hz_off() + y(Y~P) r2
 hz_off() -> hz() r3
 y(Y~P) -> y(Y~U) r4
 y() -> null() r5
 # z copy
 hz() -> hz() + z(Y~U) r1
 z(Y~U) + hx() -> hx_off() + z(Y~P) r2
 hx_off() -> hx() r3
 z(Y~P) -> z(Y~U) r4
 z() -> null() r5
end reaction rules
~~~

Specify the type of simulation and number of frames with the following: 

~~~ ruby
# i.e. 12,000 frames at 1e-6 timestep on CellBlender
simulate_nf({t_end=>.06,n_steps=>60000});
~~~

Save the file. 

On the right-hand side, click on *Simulation > Run*. After the simulation is complete, a new window will appear showing the plotted graph. As we can see, this appears to be the same behavior as the CellBlender plot but in a much cleaner pattern. Now we will perturb the file and test the robustness of this oscillator model.

In the Navigator window, right click *oscillator_copy.bngl* and copy the file. Paste a copy in the same folder and rename *oscillator_perturb.bngl*.

Add the following to the parameters: 

~~~ ruby
 # delay mechanic
 r6 1e7
 r7 4e2
 r8 1e3
 r9 2e4
 r10 1e3
~~~

Add the following to the molecule types: 

~~~ ruby
 # delay mechanic
 delay()
 a(Y~U~P)
 b()
 null()
~~~

Add the following to the species: 

~~~ ruby
 # Delay mechanic
 delay() 100
 a(Y~U) 1000
 b() 0
 null() 0
~~~

Optional: add the following to the observables: 

~~~ ruby
 Molecules D delay()
 Molecules A a()
 Molecules B b()
~~~

Add the following to the reaction rules: 
~~~ ruby
 # delay rules
 delay() + a(Y~P) -> delay() + a(Y~U) r6 
 delay() -> null() r7 
 a(Y~U) -> a(Y~P) r8 
 a(Y~P) -> b() r9 
 b() -> y(Y~U) r10 
~~~

These rules act as a delayed spike to the *y()* molecule. Once the *delay()* molecule has sufficiently decayed into *null()*,  the *a()* molecule will begin producing the *b()* molecule which will in turn produce the *y()* molecule, disrupting our initial oscillations with a large influx of *y()* molecule.

On the right-hand side, click on *Simulation > Run*. After the simulation is complete, a new window will appear showing the plotted graph. 

Can you break the oscillator model, or is it too robust? We recommend playing around with the reaction rules for *b()*- which other species could it produce? You could also adjust the starting quantities for *a(Y~U~P)*, or change the rate at which the *delay()* molecule decays!
