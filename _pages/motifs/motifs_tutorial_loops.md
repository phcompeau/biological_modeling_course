Let's take another look at that *E. coli* network, file can be downloaded here:
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/network_tf_tf_clean.txt" download="network_tf_tf_clean.txt">E. coli Network</a>

For the full Jupyter Notebook below, download here:
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/Network_Demo.ipynb" download="Network_Demo.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>

You will also need this helper file:
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/network_loader.py" download="network_loader.py">Python File</a>

The following software and packages will need to be installed:

| Installation Link | Version[^version] | Check Install |
|:------|:-----:|------:|
| [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  |3.7 |*python --version* |
| [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) | 4.4.0 | *jupyter --version* |
| [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/install.html) | 0.8.0 | *conda list* or *pip list* |

**Warning:** Be careful of the igraph installation and follow the website instructions carefully. When installing via pip or conda, specify "*python-igraph*" instead of "*igraph*".

[^version]: Other versions may be compatible with this code, but those listed are known to work for this tutorial

We can import the network and see how many nodes and edges there are, as well as count the number of loops.

~~~ python
# NOTE: when installing via pip or conda, install python-igraph
from igraph import *
from network_loader import *
import random

txt_file = 'network_tf_tf_clean.txt'

network, vertex_names = open_network(txt_file)

# how many nodes & edges
print("Number of nodes: ", len(network.vs))
print("Number of edges: ", len(network.es))
print("Number of self-loops: ", sum(Graph.is_loop(network)))
~~~

* Number of nodes:  197
* Number of edges:  477
* Number of self-loops:  130

We can also create a visualization of the graph, shown here:

~~~ python
plot(network, vertex_label=vertex_names, vertex_label_size=8,
     edge_arrow_width=1, edge_arrow_size=0.5, autocurve=True)
~~~

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_finding_ecoli_2.png){: .align-center}

We can create a random graph and visualize it here:

~~~ python
random.seed(42)
g = Graph.Erdos_Renyi(197,m=477,directed=True, loops=True)
plot(g, edge_arrow_width=1, edge_arrow_size=0.5, autocurve=True)
~~~

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_finding_random.png){: .align-center}

We can investigate how many nodes and edges and self-loops

~~~ python
# how many nodes & edges
print("Number of nodes: ", len(g.vs))
print("Number of edges: ", len(g.es))
print("Number of self-loops: ", sum(Graph.is_loop(g)))
~~~

* Number of nodes:  197
* Number of edges:  477
* Number of self-loops:  5

As we can see, the number of self-loops is significantly lower in the random graph. We encourage you to check other random graphs (change the random.seed() value) to confirm that the number of self-loops expected in a random graph is much lower than in the real e. coli network.
