## Current offline projects

## Course survey and testimonials

* If you are a learner who enjoyed this course, we would love to hear from you.

* The first way is through a survey (use the Google form from P4L as a template.)

* The second way is through writing us a testimonial -- use the contact form to get in touch!

## For instructors

* Offline dissemination. Point that it is part of the materials for PreCollege program in computational biology.

* If you are an instructor who wants to use these materials in your course, you are 100% free to as long as you point students at this website.  We only ask that you please get in touch with us because we would like to start building a network of instructors adopting this material.

* Synergies with MMBioS projects so that users of one software resource can become familiar with other resources

* Pointer to workshops that MMBioS offers -- URL: https://mmbios.pitt.edu/outreach/workshops

* Pointer to MMBioS in general with logo of MMBioS -- URL: https://mmbios.pitt.edu

* Overview of what each software resource does.

* Citation of the specific NIH grant with perhaps NIH logo. (NIH grant P41 GM103712)



* Need to explain how each of the user groups below can explore the course.  Everything from reading only the written part to getting hands dirty with a collection of in-depth software tutorials that get you comfortable with learning how the software resources presented here can be used to model biological phenomena (preparing users to be ready to apply it in their own work).

* Our target audience is broadly defined into three categories. We do not see these three user communities as non-contiguous.

1. The first category contains **casual users** who are simply curious, “What is this biological modeling at multiple scales all about?”
2. The second category contains **hands-on users** who are interested in trying out and exploring biological modeling software produced by MMBioS and learning how this software exemplifies key principles of biological modeling.
3. The third category contains **dedicated users** who have a large toolset in biological modeling and can think independently within the field.

* Plan to allow students to transition between these areas.
